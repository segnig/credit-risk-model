## üîç Interpretable Models in Light of Basel II

The **Basel II Capital Accord** significantly influences the need for interpretable and well-documented credit risk models, particularly under the Internal Rating-Based (IRB) approach. Basel II requires banks to calculate and hold regulatory capital based on internally assessed credit risk, mandating the estimation of parameters such as Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) through internal models. Subsequent frameworks‚Äîlike the US's Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management (SR 11-7) and Europe‚Äôs Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM)‚Äîhave further reinforced robust model governance. These regulations demand that models used for credit underwriting and capital calculation be conceptually sound, subject to regular validation, and inherently transparent.

An **interpretable model** enables clear understanding of decision drivers, which is crucial for:

* Explaining outcomes to applicants, auditors, and regulators
* Demonstrating fairness and absence of bias when challenged
* Maintaining an audit trail from data sources and feature engineering through to algorithm choice and validation

Well-documented models ensure transparency throughout the model lifecycle‚Äîfacilitating oversight and compliance with rigorous regulatory expectations. \[3, 6]

## üß™ Why a Proxy is Necessary Without Default Labels

In supervised learning, models require a labeled outcome. When a direct **default** label is unavailable or inconsistently defined in historical data, we create a **proxy variable**‚Äîa stand-in for the true default event, chosen for its correlation with economic loss (e.g., 90 days past due or severe delinquency indicators).

However, relying on a proxy carries business and regulatory risks:

1. **Inaccurate Risk Assessment**
   The proxy may not faithfully represent the economic or regulatory definition of default, leading to under- or overestimation of credit risk. \[2]
2. **Suboptimal Decision-Making**
   Decisions optimized for the proxy can diverge from objectives like minimizing actual credit losses or maximizing risk-adjusted returns. \[6]
3. **Validation Challenges**
   Without the true default label, rigorous back-testing and performance validation against actual losses become difficult. \[3]
4. **Regulatory Scrutiny**
   Regulators require models to be validated against relevant outcomes; proxy-based models may face additional scrutiny to prove soundness. \[3]
5. **Unintended Consequences**
   The proxy‚Äìdefault relationship can shift over time or across segments, increasing the risk of performance degradation and biased outcomes. \[5]

## ‚öñÔ∏è Interpretable vs Complex Models: A Regulatory Trade-Off

Choosing between a **simple, interpretable model** (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence) and a **complex, high-performance model** (e.g., Gradient Boosting machines like XGBoost or LightGBM) involves key trade-offs:

| Feature                | Logistic Regression (WoE) | Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Interpretability       | High                      | Low (requires SHAP/LIME)             |
| Predictive Power       | Moderate                  | High                                 |
| Regulatory Acceptance  | High                      | Medium to Low                        |
| Development Time       | Low                       | High                                 |
| Maintenance Complexity | Low                       | High                                 |

**Simple Models**:

* **Pros:** Transparent coefficients, straightforward validation, easier audit and governance. \[3, 6]
* **Cons:** May underperform when data exhibit non-linear patterns or intricate interactions. \[2]

**Complex Models**:

* **Pros:** Capture complex patterns and interactions for superior discrimination, potentially reducing credit losses and supporting financial inclusion. \[2, 3, 5]
* **Cons:** Opaque (‚Äúblack box‚Äù), requiring extensive validation efforts and advanced interpretability techniques to satisfy regulators. \[3, 6]

In practice, financial institutions often adopt a hybrid approach‚Äîusing complex models for risk segmentation and backing them with simple models or post-hoc explanations for decision justification.
